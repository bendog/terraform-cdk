## Refactoring & Renaming Resources

When working with your infrastructure definitions and the need arises to refactor or rename resources without destroying and recreating them, you can leverage the `moveTo` function like so:

```ts
new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-to", {
  bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).addMoveTarget("move-s3");

new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-from", {
  bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).moveTo("move-s3");
```

Refer to our [Refactoring Guide](/terraform/cdktf/examples-and-guides/refactoring#moving-renaming-resources-within-a-stack) for more information
